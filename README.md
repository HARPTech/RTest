Example of Usage with Regulation Kernel
---------------------------------------

The RTest application can be used to run any RSupport-based regulation kernel
application. Simply give the start command into the text input field in the lower
right corner of the application and hit "Run Wrapped Regulation Kernel".

An example for this would be the following statement:

    python3 /home/maximaximal/Dokumente/Bachelor/codebase-sequencer/example/kernel_setup.py
